# lambek-type-induction

As an exercise in learning the Lambek Calculus formalism introduced by Lambek
in "The Mathematics of Sentence Structure" (1958), we are aiming to develop the
equivalent of a grammar induction algorithm for this formalism. As opposed to
traditional grammars, the set of expression types fully determines the grammar;
there is no need for a set of production rules to define the syntax.
