# lambek-type-induction

As an exercise in learning the Lambek Calculus formalism introduced by Lambek
in "The Mathematics of Sentence Structure" (1958), we are aiming to develop the
equivalent of a grammar induction algorithm for this formalism. As opposed to
traditional grammars, the set of expression types fully determines the grammar;
there is no need for a set of production rules to define the syntax.

## TODO
- Separate out the definition of a lambek grammar from a lambek calculus, following Pentus 1993.

## Open Questions
- Are lambek grammars and context free grammars only weakly equivalent? Or are they strongly equivalent? See [equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_(formal_languages)).
